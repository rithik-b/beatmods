# ðŸš€ Project Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Requirements
- [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for the database
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or npm/pnpm/yarn) for package management

## 1. Clone the Project

Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rithik-b/beatmods.git
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd beatmods
bun i
```

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the provided example environment file to create your own configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

We will be updating this configuration with the values we need in the following steps.


## 4. Create GitHub OAuth App

Visit [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to create a new OAuth app. Fill in the required information, and set the callback URL to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:54321/auth/v1/callback
```

Copy the client ID and client secret generated here to their respective fields in `.env`

## 5. Start Supabase

At this point, make sure docker is installed and running on your system.

Start the Supabase development local development stack using the following command:

```bash
bun run supabase
```

If you want supabase studio (to edit the database with a nice GUI) you can instead run

```bash
bun run supabase:studio
```

After this runs successfully, copy the secrets generated by this command into `.env` If you lost these secrets, you can get them back by running 

```bash
bunx supabase status
```

## 6. Database Migrations

You would also need to run the database migrations so that the necessary database schemas are availaible. You can do so by running 

```bash
bun run migrate
```

## 7. Seed Data (optional)

If you would like seed data (i.e. example mods and users in the database) you can run

```bash
bun run seed
```
